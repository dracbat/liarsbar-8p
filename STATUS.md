# Status

Target: 8 players, all modes. Priority: Liar's Deck, then Liar's Dice.

`docs/PLAYER-LIMITS.md` is the map of every place the game assumes four players.
`CHANGELOG.md` is what changed in each release, and why.

## Verified from a real run

Confirmed in `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` on a live host, current build:

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Steam lobby member limit 4 → 8 | `GetLobbyMemberLimit` returns 8 |
| `NetworkServer.Listen(4)` → 8 | Mirror's real connection check |
| Steam transport server cap 4 → 8 | `[transport] server maxConnections 4 -> 8` |
| Host manager's own field 4 → 8 | the hosting instance differs from the one patched at startup |
| Turn order wrap, all five sites | `[turn] … wraps at seat 3 -> 7` |
| Deck size constant rewritten | `[decksize] DealBasicOrDevil: deck 20 -> 25` |
| 8 lobby podiums, each with its own name plate | `[podium] lobby has 8 podiums for up to 8 players` |
| Clean boot | no patch failures, no exceptions from the mod |

## Verified with other people

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| 5 players connect and stay | `connections=5`, `numPlayers=5`, no disconnects |
| No Mirror scene corruption | no `already spawned`, no duplicate NetworkManager |
| In-game seat ring and nameplates beyond 4 | seen in play |

## Not yet proven

- **A full round with eight people.** Everything above is either verified solo or
  verified at five. Six, seven and eight have never been in one lobby.
- **Where the extra lobby podiums sit visually.** They continue the arc the shipped four
  stand on, at the same radius and spacing, alternating past each end so the group stays
  compact. The lobby has no colliders to test the spots against, so this is geometry, not
  observation.
- **Liar's Dice, Chaos, Spin and Poker.** They share the turn-order and cap fixes, which
  are mode-independent, but no round has been played in them since.

## Known structural limits

- Lobby podiums cannot be spawned through Mirror — a scene object has no build-time
  assetId. The mod uses copies with a fresh, never-spawned identity, which the networking
  layer ignores; their state is therefore filled in per machine rather than synced.
- Every player must run the same version. The build is drawn top-left in game and the
  host warns about mismatches, because mixed versions have corrupted whole sessions.
