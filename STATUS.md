# Status

Target: 8 players, all modes. Priority: Liar's Deck, then Liar's Dice.

`docs/PLAYER-LIMITS.md` is the map of every place the game assumes four players.
`CHANGELOG.md` is what changed in each release, and why.

## Verified from a real run

Confirmed in `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` on a live host, current build:

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Steam lobby member limit 4 → 8 | `GetLobbyMemberLimit` returns 8 |
| `NetworkServer.Listen(4)` → 8 | Mirror's real connection check |
| Steam transport server cap 4 → 8 | `[transport] server maxConnections 4 -> 8` |
| Host manager's own field 4 → 8 | the hosting instance differs from the one patched at startup |
| Turn order wrap, all five sites | `[turn] … wraps at seat 3 -> 7` |
| Deck size constant rewritten | `[decksize] DealBasicOrDevil: deck 20 -> 25` |
| 8 lobby podiums, each with its own name plate | `[podium] lobby has 8 podiums for up to 8 players` |
| 8 podiums in two rows, all on screen | seen in a screenshot of an eight player lobby |
| 8 seated, all dealt five cards | `[dealcards] hands three seconds after the deal` lists all eight |
| Turn rotates through all eight seats | `active slot -> 4 … 5 … 6 … 7 … 0 … 1` |
| The table arrow follows the turn | `[dev:arrow] pointing the table arrow at seat 5 … 6 … 7 … 0` |
| Clean boot | no patch failures, no exceptions from the mod |

## Verified with other people

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| 5 players connect and stay | `connections=5`, `numPlayers=5`, no disconnects |
| No Mirror scene corruption | no `already spawned`, no duplicate NetworkManager |
| In-game seat ring and nameplates beyond 4 | seen in play |

## Not yet proven

- **A full round with eight people.** Everything above is either verified solo or
  verified at five. Six, seven and eight have never been in one lobby.
- **That the table arrow lands on the right person.** It is aimed at the seat in play from
  the seat ring, and the log shows it following every turn, but nobody has yet watched the
  table and confirmed the arrow is over the right player's cards.
- **The raised lobby camera.** The second row is confirmed by eye; the lift that is meant to
  clear the back row over the front has only been reasoned about, not seen.
- **Liar's Dice, Chaos, Spin and Poker.** They share the turn-order and cap fixes, which
  are mode-independent, but no round has been played in them since.

## Known structural limits

- Lobby podiums cannot be spawned through Mirror — a scene object has no build-time
  assetId. The mod uses copies with a fresh, never-spawned identity, which the networking
  layer ignores; their state is therefore filled in per machine rather than synced.
- Every player must run the same version. The build is drawn top-left in game and the
  host warns about mismatches, because mixed versions have corrupted whole sessions.
